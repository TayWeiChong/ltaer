## Introduction and Motivation

The `ltaer` package (pronounced 'later') is a convenient R wrapper for the various transportation-related APIs offered by the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (also known as the LTA Datamall). Currently, most of the APIs are geared towards app developers who use these real-time data for their mobile offerings. Used correctly and collected over a longer period of time, the data from the APIs can also serve as a rich dataset for people who are keen on analysing transportation trends in Singapore.

The key motivation behind this package is to make the data more accessible to a wider audience. While it is not difficult to call the API directly using the `httr` package on R, it does require a greater understanding of R and APIs that a casual user may not possess. An important part of open data is accessibility, and I hope that this package will constitute a small step towards that goal for Singapore.

## How to use this website

You will find two vignettes (detailed explanations for how to use this package) on this website: one for the core functions, and another for visualisation possibilities. These can be found by clicking on 'Articles' above and choosing the vignette you want to read.

If you want to dive directly into the documentation for each function within the package, click on 'Reference' instead which will lead you to a page with links to each function's documentation.
